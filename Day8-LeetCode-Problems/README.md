## Day8-LeetCode-Problems
# Coding Challenges

This repository contains solutions to three classic coding problems related to arrays and greedy algorithms.

## Problems

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Product of Array Except Self
**Problem:** Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`. 

**Constraints:**
- Must run in **O(n)** time.
- **No division operation allowed**.

**Example:**
```python
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Gas Station Circuit
**Problem:** Given `n` gas stations with `gas[i]` amount of gas and `cost[i]` required to travel to the next station, find the **starting gas station index** to complete a full circle. If not possible, return `-1`.

**Constraints:**
- **Unique solution guaranteed** if a solution exists.

**Example:**
```python
Input: gas = [1,2,3,4,5], cost = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 3
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Candy Distribution
**Problem:** `n` children stand in a line, each with a `rating[i]`. Distribute candies following rules:
- Each child gets **at least one** candy.
- Higher-rated children get **more** than their neighbors.
- Find the **minimum candies** needed.

**Example:**
```python
Input: ratings = [1,0,2]
Output: 5  # [2,1,2]
```
